# Timezone Calc
Welcome to the Timezone Calculator!

Timezone Calculator can be used to grab current timezones around the world as well as calculating a time relative to a given timezone.
The calculator takes into account DST and adjusts all calculations accordingly.

In its current state the calculator will only calculate times for the current day.
Increased functionality will hopefully cover this in the future as well as being able to configure your own choice of timezones. 

Instructions:

** All times use a 24 hour clock format **

1) "Timezone"
This dropdown is used alongside the "TargetTime" function.
Choose a timezone you wish to base a time calculation from.

2) "Current Time"
Check this box and hit "GO!" to show a list of current
times.

3) "Target Time"
Check this box, enter a target time (hour and minute) 
and then hit GO!
This will show you times around the world relative to the 
timezone and target time you have chosen.

** Example Usage **
A client lives in China. They are free for a meeting at 16:00
Chinese Local time.
1. Choose CN (China) from the drop down list
2. Check target time box
3. Enter Hour = 16 and Minute = 00
4. Hit Go!

The output will give you relative times across the world to help 
coordinate your meetings!
